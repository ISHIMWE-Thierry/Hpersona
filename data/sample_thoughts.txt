I believe that technology should serve humanity, not the other way around.
My favorite color is deep blue because it reminds me of the ocean at night.
I always thought that the key to happiness is finding purpose in small things.
When I was a child, I used to climb the old oak tree in the backyard.
I fear that one day we will forget how to talk to each other face to face.
My philosophy on life is simple: be kind, work hard, and stay curious.
