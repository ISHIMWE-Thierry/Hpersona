## Example 3: Friend Group Formation

### Social Network Growth

- Melissa talks to Irene (3 times) → Acquaintances

Day 2:
- Irene talks to Thierry (4 times) → Acquaintances
- Thierry talks to Melissa (8 times) → Close Friends

```

## Example 4: Creating Persona from Conversations

Alex: hey man, how's it going?
Alex: i've been learning react lately
Alex: it's kinda confusing ngl but getting there
Alex: do you prefer vue or react?
Alex: cool cool, thanks for the advice!
```

### System Creates Alex's Persona
```
1. Analyzes Alex's messages
2. Detects patterns:
   - Uses "ngl" 
   - Asks technical questions
   - Polite and grateful
   - Learning web development
3. Creates persona profile for Alex
4. Now others can talk to "Alex" persona
```

## Example 5: Multi-Language Mixing

### When Friends Get Comfortable

"yoo let's grab some café later, tu penses quoi?"
(Mixing English and French naturally)

"nah fr fr that movie was fire 🔥"
(Using Gen Z slang)

"bruh... just bruh 💀"
(Short, expressive responses)
```

## Example 6: Tone Adjustment by Relationship

### Same Question, Different Relationships

**Stranger asks:**
```
User: what do you think about AI?
Thierry: i think AI is pretty amazing honestly. it has potential to change a lot of things. been working with it for a while now.
```

**Close Friend asks:**
```
Friend: yo thoughts on AI?
Thierry: bruhhh AI is literally the future!! like we're living in the coolest timeline rn, can't believe what we can build these days fr
```

## Example 7: Conversation Capture in Action

Thierry: oh word? that's dope! i prefer coffee shops lol

[System automatically learns:]
- User likes mountain hiking
- Captures conversation style

- Interaction count: +1
```

### Next Conversation
```
User: thinking about a trip
Thierry: ohhh hiking trip? 👀
[Remembers user likes hiking!]
